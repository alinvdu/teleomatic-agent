# teleomatic-agent
Teleomatic Agent is an experimental AI system designed to autonomously generate intrinsic goals, simulate emotion-like states, and pursue self-directed objectives. Built on top of the Llama 3 language model, this project explores the intersection of reinforcement learning, affective computing, and curiosity-driven behavior in artificial agents.
