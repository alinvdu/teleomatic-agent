# Teleomatic Agent

## Description ##
Teleomatic Agent is an experimental AI system designed to autonomously generate intrinsic goals, simulate emotion-like states, and pursue self-directed objectives. Built on top of the Llama 3 language model, this project explores the intersection of reinforcement learning, affective computing, and curiosity-driven behavior in artificial agents.

## Features ##
	•	Intrinsic Goal Generation: Enables the agent to create and pursue its own goals based on internal motivation and external inputs.
	•	Curiosity-Driven Exploration: Uses reinforcement learning to reward the agent for discovering novel information or solving new types of problems.
	•	Emotional State Simulation: Simulates states like satisfaction, frustration, and curiosity, which dynamically influence decision-making and behavior.
	•	Self-Reflective Memory: Integrates long-term memory to track the agent’s progress, allowing it to reflect on past actions and refine its goals over time.
	•	Reward-Based Learning: Combines intrinsic motivation and external feedback to optimize the agent’s performance toward both internal and external objectives.
